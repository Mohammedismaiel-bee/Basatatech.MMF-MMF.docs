## Task details

## Analyze Architecture and Parameters

#### 1. Architectural Analysis:

- Conduct an in-depth analysis of the system's architecture, focusing on the "Connect" component.
- Identify key architectural components and their interactions.

#### 2. Design Connect Architecture:

- Develop a comprehensive architectural design for the "Connect" module, considering scalability, security, and reliability.

#### 3. Database Architecture Analysis:

- Evaluate the new database architecture to ensure it aligns with project requirements and performance goals.

#### 4. Extract Connect Input Parameters:

- Identify and document the input parameters required for the "Connect" module, ensuring clear definitions and data sources.

#### 5. Extract Connect Output Parameters:

- Define and document the output parameters generated by the "Connect" module, specifying their format and purpose.

#### 6. configure the database connection to write and listen for notifications

- listen on a web socket channel to get the commited transactions
- add transaction to transaction pool if allowed

#### 7. Configure Connect:

- Configure the "Connect" module by adding necessary settings and parameters in the CC (CCOffice) database.
  - Configure the "Connect" module settings.
  - Configure "Connect" module specific configurations.

## Design the Service Layer for Connect

#### 1. Design Adding Fund Service: (happy scenario & test cases)

- Create a detailed design for the "Adding Fund" service within the "Connect" module, specifying its functions and interactions.

#### 2. Design Withdraw Fund Service: (happy scenario & test cases)

- Develop a comprehensive design for the "Withdraw Fund" service, outlining its operations and dependencies.

#### 3. Design Cancel Fund Service: (happy scenario & test cases)

- Design the "Cancel Fund" service, defining its behavior and integration points.

## Implementation of Service Layer for Connect

#### 1. Implement Adding Fund Service:

- Develop the implementation for the "Adding Fund" service.
- Establish mechanisms to:
  - Listen for notifications from the CC (CCOffice) system based on approval requests.
  - Validate transaction data for fund addition.
  - Send fund addition requests to CIC (Capital Cash).
  - Update transaction records based on response data.

#### 2. Implement Withdraw Fund Service:

- Implement the "Withdraw Fund" service, considering the following steps:
  - Listen for notifications from the CC system related to withdrawal requests.
  - Validate transaction data for fund withdrawal.
  - Send lookup requests to retrieve validation constraints.
  - Submit withdrawal fund requests to CIC.
  - Update transaction records based on the response received.

#### 3. Implement Cancel Fund Service:

- Develop the implementation for the "Cancel Fund" service, including:
  - Listening for notifications from the CC system regarding cancelation requests.
  - Sending cancel fund requests to CIC.
  - Updating transaction records based on the response received.

## testing fase

#### Unit teting

- perform unit testing for controller layer
- for service layer ( adding fund & withdraw & cancel)
- for repository layer (connecting to database and functionality)
- for web socket layer (notifications from database)
- for config layer

#### Integration testing

- perform integration testing for controller layer
- for web socket layer (notifications from database)
